Basically Cric-Learner is designed for the following two purposes :
1) Ever wondered ! why india only wins 4-5 medals in Olympics while other countries like USA and China wins hundreds of medals. The answer is that we lag behind them in providing our players a proper guidance, training, techniques and equipments. The same scenario is with every sports in India. The Scenario is that in many remote areas there is not even a single sports committee or an organization to look after the sporting skills of a player and that's a huge reason why a mojarity of people who have love ,passion and calibre for any sports are unable to persue it for their career.

Cric-Learners is an online platform to provide free and proper cricketting skills, guidance, tips and techniques to these players. With the help of this platform even individuals from remote areas have access to the proper guidance and roadmap for grooming their sporting skills.
